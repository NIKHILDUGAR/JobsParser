##Parses for jobs on indeed.com , monster.com , naukri.com after getting type of job and location from input.
This is a parser that takes a skill/type of job as input and a location of the job (optional) to search and parses through all the results on sites like #naukri .com, #monster .com and #indeed .com and stores the job name, salary, company name, locations the job is available (in case no location is provided)and the link of the job's page in a .csv file. This repository has the python file along with sample output. I hope to add more features to it.
